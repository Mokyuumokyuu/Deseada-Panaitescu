                <p>All I can say is that in the beginning I did not expect to end up studying what I am currently studying. My vision, if we can call it that, was aimed more towards the 'free' arts and I ended up working on admission portfolios for programs focused on Illustration and Graphi Storytelling. In the end I decided I wanted more of a chalange and that I want to jump into something completely new. So I did, and now I'm here. So far so good!   </p>
